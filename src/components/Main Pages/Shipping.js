        <p>
          Due to the impact of COVID-19 on various shipping carriers we have
          been experiencing sporadic moments of shipping delays. These delays
          are unfortunately out of our control, however we are doing everything
          we can to minimize and mitigate these delays from happening whenever
          possible.

          We appreciate your patience and understanding with us while we all
          navigate and manage these issues if and when they arise. We will
          always have your back and will continue to do everything we can to
          make sure you receive your order as quickly as possible.
